Wordle is basically an addictive guessing game. Everyday the whole world has to guess the same five-letter word in six tries.

If you guess the right letter in a wrong spot, it turns yellow. The right letter in the right spot turns green.

Use the API to deploy the new word to guess and also to check if a guessed word is the real word.

Guess the WORDLE in six tries.

Each guess must be a valid five-letter word. Hit the enter button to submit.

After each guess, the color of the tiles will change to show how close your guess was to the word.

Examples

The letter W is in the word and in the correct spot.

The letter I is in the word but in the wrong spot.

The letter U is not in the word in any spot.

A new WORDLE will be available each day!
